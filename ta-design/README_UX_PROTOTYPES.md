## üéØ What Each Prototype Teaches

### Prototype 1: Ranking Algorithm Visualizer
**Learn**: How 5 factors combine into a transparent score

```
Your Actions:         System Response:
Drag sliders    ‚Üí     Rankings recompute instantly
                      Score breakdown updates
                      "Why" explanations adapt
```

**Aha Moment**: 85.7% of students pick option #1. This means the ranking is intuitive and trustworthy.

### Prototype 2: Live Booking Simulator
**Learn**: FCFS queue ensures fairness; hard constraints caught early

```
Your Actions:         System Response:
Click options   ‚Üí     Student books (green ‚úì)
                      Student fails (red ‚ùå)
Run simulation  ‚Üí     All queue executes
                      Speed slider controls animation
```

**Aha Moment**: Student F has no options (Chemistry @8am, tutor only teaches 4pm). This is caught early and surfaces as a constraint violation.

### Prototype 3: Load Balancing Dynamics
**Learn**: How to distribute load fairly across tutors

```
Your Actions:         System Response:
Click +/- buttons ‚Üí   Utilization updates
                      Health status changes
                      Fairness metrics recalculate
Adjust weight   ‚Üí     Recommendations shift
                      Underutilized tutors rank higher
```

**Aha Moment**: Std Dev < 15œÉ means fair distribution. Load-balance heuristic actively prevents bottlenecks on popular tutors.

## üé® Design Philosophy

**Inspired by Brett Victor + Steve Wittens**

### Principles Applied
1. **Make the invisible visible**
   - Every score is shown with breakdown
   - All calculations explained
   - No black-box rankings

2. **Hands-on interaction**
   - Drag sliders ‚Üí changes happen instantly
   - Click buttons ‚Üí queue progresses
   - Real-time feedback on every action

3. **Mathematical elegance**
   - 5-factor scoring is simple but powerful
   - Datalog constraints ensure feasibility
   - Load-balance formula visually intuitive

4. **Transparency & trust**
   - Students see why they got matched with a tutor
   - Tutors see why they have their utilization
   - Everyone understands the system

---

## üìä Validation Numbers

From spike testing (see `SPIKE_SUMMARY.md`):

```
Feasible options generated:           75 tuples
Students with viable options:         7/8 (87.5%)
Average options per student:          10.7 (range 2-21)

First-choice match rate:              85.7% (6/7 booked)
Scheduling conflicts:                 0 (perfect FCFS)
Hard constraint catches:              1 (Student F)
Load balance fairness:                Verified ‚úì

Fulfillment rate (spike):             87.5%
Production target:                    ‚â•95%
```

---

## üîß Customization

### To Modify Default Weights
Edit `src/components/RankingVisualizer.tsx`:
```typescript
const [weights, setWeights] = useState({
  tutorPref: 30,        // ‚Üê Change these values
  timePattern: 25,
  explicitTime: 20,
  loadBalance: 15,
  satisfaction: 10,
})
```

### To Add More Test Data
Edit `src/components/BookingSimulator.tsx`:
```typescript
const [students, setStudents] = useState<BookingState[]>([
  // Add more student objects here
])
```

### To Change Colors/Styling
All colors use Tailwind classes:
- `.bg-blue-600` ‚Üí Change to `.bg-indigo-600`
- `.text-slate-900` ‚Üí Change to `.text-slate-950`
- All components editable in `src/components/`

### To Rebuild (If Customized)
```bash
cd tutoring_ux_suite
pnpm install
pnpm run build
npx html-inline dist/index.html > dist/bundle.html
# Use new bundle.html as your artifact
```
