A comprehensive suite of 5 innovative UX prototypes for your tutoring scheduler system

## ðŸŽ¨ **Your Interactive Prototypes**

### [1. Comprehensive Scheduling Suite](tutor-agency-ux_v3/tutoring-scheduler-prototype.html)
A full-featured prototype with 4 interactive views:
- **Constraint Visualization** - Real-time Datalog rules and feasibility matrix
- **Ranking Explorer** - Draggable weights to see how recommendations change
- **Student Scheduler** - Apple-inspired booking interface with top-3 recommendations
- **Load Balance** - Live utilization heatmaps and metrics

### [2. Explorable Constraint Solver](tutor-agency-ux_v3/constraint-solver-exploration.html)
Brett Victor-style direct manipulation:
- **Draggable Values** - Adjust tutors, students, slots with mouse drag
- **Live Constraint Flow** - See how data flows through the system
- **Interactive Equations** - Mathematical formulas that respond to input
- **Feasibility Matrix** - Explore how constraints affect possibilities

### [3. Real-Time Dashboard](tutor-agency-ux_v3/realtime-scheduling-dashboard.html)
Steve Wittens-inspired mathematical visualizations:
- **Animated Particle System** - WebGL-like background effects
- **Live Metrics** - Real-time booking and satisfaction data
- **Interactive Schedule Grid** - Ripple effects and smooth transitions
- **Beautiful Charts** - Load distribution and satisfaction trends

### [4. Physics-Based Booking](tutor-agency-ux_v3/physics-based-booking.html)
Innovative force-directed interface:
- **Spring Physics** - Nodes attract and repel with realistic physics
- **Drag to Connect** - Create matches by bringing nodes together
- **Visual Constraints** - See connections form and break in real-time
- **Magnetic Drop Zones** - Feel the pull of compatible matches

### [5. Student Journey Flow](tutor-agency-ux_v3/student-journey-flow.html)
Beautiful step-by-step booking experience:
- **Animated Journey Path** - SVG path that draws as you progress
- **Interactive Nodes** - Each step reveals new interactions
- **Constraint Satisfaction** - Watch constraints get satisfied in real-time
- **Success Animations** - Delightful particle effects on completion
